    The Demo - Animated Creatures scene uses 16:9 aspect ratio.

Scripts
    The script titled "Creatures_ShadowSwitch" is used for turning off a creature prefab's shadow in the editor.
    Attach the script to the prefab of your choice and use the checkbox to turn the prefab's shadow off and on.

Prefabs
    All creature prefabs are configured in the following format:
        Empty Parent
            -> Model: contains the SpriteRenderer and Animator components for the creature.
                -> Shadow: contains the SpriteRenderer and Animator components for the creature's shadow.

Animations
    All creature animations animate both the creature model and creature shadow within one animation.

Animator Controllers and Animator Override Controllers
    Creature animator controllers are grouped together based on common animations. Most creatures will have an Animator Override Controller.
    For example, the standard slimes and mother slimes all have the same 4 animations. 
        There is a single animator controller called "Slime_AnimatorController" that acts as a base animator controller for each Slime.
        Each Slime has their own Animator Override Controller that overrides the animations on the base Animator controller.
